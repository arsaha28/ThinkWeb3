    <div class="container">
      <h3>NFT</h3>
      <p class="text-left">An NFT is a Non-Fungible Token, which represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique digital asset such as a piece of art, music, or video. NFTs use blockchain technology to verify ownership and authenticity, making them unique and indivisible, unlike fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <h3>SmartContract</h3>

      <p class="text-left">A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist on a blockchain network, allowing for secure and transparent execution of the contract without the need for intermediaries.</p>
      <h3>ERC721</h3>
      <p class="text-left">An ERC-721 token is a type of non-fungible token that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 721 standard. ERC-721 tokens are unique, meaning each one is distinct and cannot be replicated or divided, making them ideal for representing unique assets such as artwork or collectibles.</p>
      <h3>ERC20</h3>
      <p class="text-left">An ERC-20 token is a type of fungible token that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20 standard. ERC-20 tokens are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, making them ideal for representing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.</p>
      <h3>IPFS</h3>
      <p class="text-left">IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol and network designed to create a peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. IPFS allows for permanent and decentralized storage of digital files, allowing for faster access to content and reducing the need for centralized servers and services.</p>
      <h3>MetaMask</h3>
      <p class="text-left">MetaMask is a browser extension and digital wallet that allows users to interact with decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to manage their digital assets and interact with smart contracts, making it a popular choice for users looking to participate in the growing NFT ecosystem.</p>
      <h3>OpenZeppelin</h3>
      <p class="text-left">OpenZeppelin is an open-source framework for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a library of pre-written and tested smart contracts, making it easier and faster for developers to build secure and complex decentralized applications, including NFTs. </p>
      <h3>Solidity</h3>
      <p class="text-left">Solidity is a high-level programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It was developed specifically for the Ethereum platform and is similar to JavaScript, allowing developers to write, test, and deploy smart contracts with ease. </p>
