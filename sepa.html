      <h1>ISO20022</h1>

      <h1>SEPA Transfer Steps</h1>
    
    <h2>Customer-to-Bank Transfer</h2>
    <p>Here's an example of the steps involved in a customer-to-bank transfer using the SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT) scheme:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The customer initiates the payment instruction through their bank's online banking portal or other electronic channels.</li>
      <li>The customer's bank validates the payment instruction and sends it to the clearing and settlement mechanism (CSM) responsible for processing SCT payments.</li>
      <li>The CSM processes the payment instruction and sends it to the receiving bank.</li>
      <li>The receiving bank credits the recipient's account with the payment amount.</li>
      <li>The receiving bank sends a confirmation message (such as a PAIN.002 message) to the sending bank, indicating that the payment has been received and credited to the recipient's account.</li>
      <li>The sending bank sends a confirmation message to the customer, indicating that the payment has been successfully processed and credited to the recipient's account.</li>
    </ol>
